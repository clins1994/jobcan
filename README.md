# Jobcan

This extension is a tool to simplify the infamous [Jobcan](https://am.jobcan.com.vn/en/) time and attendance system. It is a system that works but is a pain to use in terms of UI and UX. This extension aims to make it easier to use by providing a simpler and intuitive interface starting with clocking in and out functionalities but can be extended to other functionalities in the future.
